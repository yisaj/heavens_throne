GAME DESIGN
    Win conditions
        - Be the last order standing by capturing other temples (domination?)
        - Capturing and hold heaven's throne for 3 days (ascension?)

    Capturing locations
        - Staying on the same location for a turn without combat will capture.
        - Capturing an enemy temple inhibits respawns for that order.

    Battle simulation
        - 3 lines of combat: cavalry, front, back.
        - Defender's bonus. (bonus for being on a captured location? bonus for
          not moving?)
        - Single round of attacks?
