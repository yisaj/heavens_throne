GAME DESIGN
    Win conditions
        - Be the last order standing by capturing other temples (domination?)
        - Capturing and hold heaven's throne for 3 days (ascension?)

    Capturing locations
        - Staying on the same location for a turn without combat will capture.
        - Capturing an enemy temple inhibits respawns for that order.

    Battle simulation
        - 3 lines of combat: cavalry, front, back.
        - Defender's bonus. (bonus for being on a captured location? bonus for
          not moving?)
        - Single round of attacks?

    Player progression
        Players can gain exp by:
            - Capturing locations
            - Participating in battles
            - Winning battles
            - Surviving battles
            - Just existing

    Classes
        - Recruit
        - Cavalry
        - Spearman
        - Glavier
        - Swordsman
        - Spellcaster
        - Archer
        -

    Things that can happen to a player:
        - Survive
        - Routed (cavalry affected?)
        - Killed

Two issues: engagement and combat
How do units choose who to attack and when?
How do units take damage?

Three important attributes of units: Damage, Durability, Speed

Stages of combat:
cavalry attacks
archers attack
infantry attacks



spears
swords
horses
shields
bows
spells

stats?
initiative/speed
attack
defense
range
aggro

infantry (low speed)
    -> spear (bonus against cavalry) # -> glaivemaster (counter attacks) #
    -> sword (tanking) # -> bulwark (super tank, plus aggro) #
cavalry (high speed)
    -> heavy (greater attack) # -> monster rider (can only be hit by archers) #
    -> light (higher speed) # -> horse archer (ignores aggro) #
ranger (medium speed)
    -> archer (dps) # -> spellcaster (can hit multiple)
    -> medic (increases allies defense) # -> druidic healer (can revive units) #

randomly select a unit
that unit attacks another random enemy unit

cavalry and heavy cavalry are much more likely to hit cavalry and frontline
light cavalry are equally likely to hit

//frontline are much more likely to hit cavalry and frontline

//archers are equally likely to hit everyone
//healers are more likely to hit frontline and backline
